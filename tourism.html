       <p>Formerly known as Mankal, Golconda fort was built by Kakatiya Kings and completed by Rani Rudrama and her successor Prataparudra.
          However, the structure that we see today was renovated by the Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk from Qutb Shahi dynasty, who chose Golconda to be the center of his governance. The fort is an engineering marvel and is considered one of the best Hyderabad tourist places. A hand clap at a certain place below the entrance of the dome of Fateh Darwaza echoes and can be heard at Bala Hissar pavilion, which is the highest point of the fort and is almost a kilometer away! Also, the fort has eight gateways, several temples, mosques, stables, royal chambers, and four moveable bridges. The magnificent fort is built on a granite hill and once stored the world-famous Koh-i-Noor, Hope diamond, and Daria-i-Noor.
          It overlooks the city and is a must visit place for magnificent architecture and historical significance.

     <p>The Four Minarets, also known as Charminar, is another monument built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty.
      There are many folklores about the true origin of this building with some suggesting that the structure was built to mark the end of an extremely deadly Cholera.
       There's another interesting tale that Charminar was the spot where Qutb Shahi got the first glimpse of his future queen to be Rani Bhagmati.
        Charminar is a square structure made of granite, pulverized marble, mortar and limestone and is known for its balustrades, balconies and stucco decorations.
         The four minarets that are 56-meters tall stand at each corner of the main structure. Each minaret has a double balcony, and there are 149 steps to reach the upper floor. 
         There is a mosque on the top floor of the four-storied Charminar.
      It is said that an underground tunnel that was built to help kings and queens escape during an enemy attack connects Charminar with Golconda fort.

<p>One of the oldest monuments in the city, Qutub Shahi Tombs were built by Sultan Quli. 
  The tombs are located in Ibrahim Bagh and are approximately 850 meters away from Banjara Darwaza of Golconda fort. 
  These complexes are either one story or two storied and have mosques and tombs of kings of Qutub Shahi Dynasty.
   What's interesting is that an inscribed sarcophagus covers the actual burial vault at the center of each tomb. 
   The domes originally had beautiful blue-green tile work, but only a few pieces remain as evidence to this fact.
   The structure of the tombs is influenced by Persian, Pathan, Deccan and Hindu styles.

<p>With the capacity of hosting 10,000 people, Makkah Masjid is the largest mosque in India.
  It was built in the 17th century and takes the name from the Grand Mosque of Mecca. 
  The bricks used in the central archway of the structure are made from the soil sourced from Mecca. 
  It is said that around 8000 masons worked round the clock to complete the construction in 77 years. 
  The three fascinating and exquisitely designed facades are carved out of a single granite stone which took the large team of workers five years to quarry. 
  This structure was comprehensively designed and has floral motifs and friezes with cornices running around the entire mosque’s complex.
  The courtyard entrance is home to the Asaf Jah ruler's marble gravesite.

  The palace spreads across 32 acres of land and was constructed with Italian marble. 
  Though the construction started in 1884, it took almost 9 years to complete the structure. Built in the shape of a scorpion, the palace has 220 rooms and 22 halls. 
  The stained-glass windows, frescoes-decorated ceilings, magnificent Jade collection, Venetian chandeliers and statues, and paintings give a peek into the luxurious life of Nizams.
   The library has an elegantly carved walnut roof which is an exact copy of the one in Windsor Castle. 
 Another fascinating fact about the palace is that Burroughs and Watts from England created two indistinguishable billiards tables, with one kept in Buckingham Palace and the other in the billiards rooms of this palace.

<p>This beautiful mosque in Hyderabad is also called the Mosque of the Moors because of the Moorish style of architecture that is not found anywhere else in India.
  The construction of the mosque started under the orders of Vikar-ul-Umra, Iqbal ud Dowla, under the rule of Nizam Mir Mahbub Ali Khan Bahadur.
   The construction was completed by his elder son Nawab Sultan Ul Mulk Bahadur. This masjid has two other names Masjid Iqbal Ud Daula and Aiwan-E-Begumpet. 
   The design of the mosque is inspired by the Cathedral-Mosque of Córdoba in Spain. It has Quranic verses engraved on the walls.
  The most interesting feature is the spires instead of the usual circular domes that give the mosque a church-like appearance.
